# Assignment 3: User Management and File System Access

## Step 1: Creating Users  
- First, I created two users: *tupu* and *lupu*.  
- Then, I set *passwords* and other necessary details to ensure only they can access their files.  
- I used the sudo and adduser commands for this:  

        sudo adduser tupu  

## Step 2: Creating the lupu User  
- Next, I created the lupu user using the useradd command:  

        sudo useradd -m -d /home/lupu -s /bin/bash -G lupu lupu  

  Explanation of flags:  
  - -m: Creates the user's home directory.  
  - -d /home/lupu: Specifies the home directory path.  
  - -s /bin/bash: Sets the login shell to Bash.  
  - -G lupu: Adds the user to the lupu group.  

## Step 3: Creating the hupu System User  
- Additionally, I created a system user named hupu, with the login shell set to */bin/false* to prevent login:  

        sudo useradd --system --shell /bin/false hupu  

  Explanation of flags:  
  - --system: Creates a system account.  
  - --shell /bin/false: Prevents the user from logging in.  

## Step 4: Granting Sudo Privileges  
- I used *visudo* to edit the sudoers file:  

        sudo visudo  

- Then, I added the following lines to grant sudo access to both users:  

        tupu ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL  
        lupu ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL  

- There are alternative methods to do this, but I chose this approach while testing both.  


## Step 5:
- I create directory in */opt/projekti* and add both users

        sudo mkdir /opt/projekti

- Then crete a group called projekti and assign both tupu and lupu into the group and the commands are:

        sudo groupadd projekti
        sudo usermod -aG projekti tupu
        sudo usermod -aG projekti lupu

- And give ownership to projekti group.

        sudo chown :projekti /opt/projekti

- And *set permission* so that tupu and lupu can access the file in all three formate like read, write and execute files.



        sudo chmod 770 /opt/projekti

- The following command ensures that any new files created within the /opt/projekti directory inherit the group ownership of projekti, maintaining the desired permissions.

        sudo chmod g+s /opt/projekti

## Output:

        drwxrws--- 2 root projekti 4096 Jan 30 16:02 /opt/projekti

### Here is the screenshots of the practical.

![alt text](COMMAND2.png)


# Account Setup
- In  the first step, I'd create an Microsoft Azure account using email address that university provoded me.

- Then I got  to know about the cloud and it's importance. 

- Additionally, I explored student benefits  and open an student account and Azure give me **$100** worth of credits that I can use to purchase any pachage within the environment.


# Create Virtual Machine
- I created virtual machine where I have to work later on this course.

- Then I select Marketplace from **Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS gen 2 Server** published by Canonical. 

- I named my machine **"lab-robotics"**.

- I choose B series version 2 which is **Standard_B2ls_v2**.

- Later, I create a new resource group for the machine and subnet to place the machine in.

# Link my HAMK email to my GitHub account

- I create a new repository named **"linux"** for the assignment.

- Then I add my HAMK email as a secondary mail for version control.

# Assignment 3: User Management and File System Access

## Step 1: Creating Users
- Created two users: **tupu** and **lupu**.
- Set **passwords** and other necessary information to restrict access.
- Used `sudo` and `adduser` commands:

        sudo adduser tupu

## Step 2: Creating the Lupu User
- Used `useradd` command for `lupu`:

        sudo useradd -m -d /home/lupu -s /bin/bash -G lupu lupu

- Options explained:
  - `-m`: Create the home directory.
  - `-d /home/lupu`: Specify the home directory path.
  - `-s /bin/bash`: Set the login shell.
  - `-G lupu`: Add the user to the lupu group.

## Step 3: Creating the Hupu System User
- Created a system user `hupu` with login shell set to `/bin/false`:

       sudo useradd --system --shell /bin/false hupu

- Explanation:
  - `--system`: Create a system account.
  - `--shell /bin/false`: Prevent user login.

## Step 4: Granting Sudo Privileges
- Edited sudoers file using **visudo**:

        sudo visudo

- Added permissions:

        tupu ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
        lupu ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

- Alternatively, added users to the sudo group:

        sudo usermod -aG sudo tupu
        sudo usermod -aG sudo lupu

## Step 5: Setting Up `/opt/projekti` Directory
- Created directory:

        sudo mkdir /opt/projekti

- Created a group `projekti` and assigned both users:

        sudo groupadd projekti
        sudo usermod -aG projekti tupu
        sudo usermod -aG projekti lupu

- Set ownership and permissions:

        sudo chown :projekti /opt/projekti
        sudo chmod 770 /opt/projekti

- Ensured new files inherit `projekti` group ownership:

        sudo chmod g+s /opt/projekti

## Output
Expected directory permissions:

        drwxrws--- 2 root projekti 4096 Jan 30 16:02 /opt/projekti

## APT Package Management Assignment

## **Part 1: Understanding APT & System Updates**

### **1. Check APT Version**
```bash
apt --version
```
**Output:**  _(apt --version
apt 2.7.14 (amd64)
**Screenshoot**
![](![Screenshot (12)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d54e510f-e4b0-421b-b22f-2b04edbe3dbb)

### **2. Update the Package List**
```bash
sudo apt update
```
**Explanation:** This command fetches the latest package lists from configured repositories, ensuring we get the latest versions and security updates.

### **3. Upgrade Installed Packages**
```bash
sudo apt upgrade -y
```
**Difference between `update` and `upgrade`:**  
- `update`: Refreshes the package list but doesnâ€™t install updates.
- `upgrade`: Installs the latest versions of all packages listed in the updated package list.

### **4. View Pending Updates**
```bash
apt list --upgradable
```
**Pending Updates:**  Ahmad-113@lab-robotics:~$ apt list --upgradable
Listing... Done

# Difference between remove and purge:

- Remove: Deletes the package but keeps configuration files.
- Purge: Deletes both the package and its configuration files.

# 3. Clear Unnecessary Package Dependencies
sudo apt autoremove -y
# Why is this step important?

- It removes unneeded dependencies that were installed automatically.
- Frees up disk space.
### 4. Clean Up Downloaded Package Files
sudo apt clean
# What does this command do?

- It removes cached package files from /var/cache/apt/archives.
- Helps free up disk space.
### Part 4: Managing Repositories & Troubleshooting
*** 1. List All APT Repositories
cat /etc/apt/sources.list

### What do you notice in this file?

- It contains a list of repositories (deb or deb-src lines).
- Lists sources where packages are downloaded from.
# 2. Add the Universe Repository
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt update
# What types of packages are found in the universe repository?

- Community-maintained software, not officially supported by Ubuntu.
# 3. Simulate an Installation Failure and Troubleshoot
sudo apt install fakepackage
*** Output:
E: Unable to locate package fakepackage
# How would you troubleshoot this issue?

- Verify that the package name is correct.
- Run sudo apt update to refresh package lists.
- Check if the package is in the enabled repositories.
# Bonus Challenge (Optional)
# Hold a Package
sudo apt-mark hold zim
# Why would you want to hold a package?

- To prevent updates that might break compatibility.
### Unhold a Package
sudo apt-mark unhold zim

# Part 1: Virtualization Concepts

### Research on Virtualization Concepts

Virtualization enables running multiple operating systems or applications on the same physical machine using a hypervisor. There are two main types of virtualization:

Full Virtualization (VMs): Uses a hypervisor to emulate hardware and run multiple OS instances.

Container-Based Virtualization: Uses OS-level isolation to run multiple applications in isolated user spaces.
